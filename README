Advanced viewshed analysis for QGIS
===================================

Viewshed analysis calculates visible surface from a given observer point over a digital elevation model. Basic viewshed analysis can  be be made in QGIS environment through performant GRASS viewshed algorithm *r.los* or SAGA viewshed module. However, these solutions give only a simple binary viewshed (true/false for each evaluated location). For more complex (and more interesting!) analyses a good amount of programming is required.
